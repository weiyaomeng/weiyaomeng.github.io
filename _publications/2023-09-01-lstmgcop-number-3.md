Abstract
----
With a recently defined AutoGCOP framework, the design of local search algorithms has been defined as the composition of elementary algorithmic components. The effective compositions of the best algorithms thus retain useful knowledge of effective algorithm design. This paper investigates machine learning to learn and extract useful knowledge in the effective algorithmic compositions. The process of forecasting algorithmic components in the design of effective local search algorithms is defined as a sequence classification task, and solved by a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network to systematically analyse algorithmic compositions. Compared with other learning models, the results reveal the superior prediction performance of the proposed LSTM. Further analysis identifies some key features of algorithmic compositions and confirms their effectiveness for improving the prediction, thus to support effective automated algorithm design.
