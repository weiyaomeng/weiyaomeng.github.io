Abstract
----
With a recently defined AutoGCOP framework, the design of local
search algorithms can be defined as the composition of the basic
elementary algorithmic components. These compositions into the
best algorithms thus retain useful knowledge of effective algorithm
design. This paper investigates effective algorithmic compositions
with sequential rule mining techniques to discover valuable knowledge in algorithm design. With the collected effective algorithmic
compositions, sequential rules of basic algorithmic components are
extracted and further analysed to automatically compose basic algorithmic components within the general AutoGCOP framework to
develop new effective meta-heuristics. The sequential rules present
superior performance in composing the basic algorithmic components for solving the benchmark vehicle routing problems with time
window constraints, demonstrating its effectiveness in designing
new algorithms automatically.
