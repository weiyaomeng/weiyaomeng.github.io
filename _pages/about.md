I am currently a PhD student at the [Computational Optimization and Learning (COL) Lab](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/col/) in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/) and a Teaching Associate in the Faculty of Science at the University of Nottingham.

Research
======

My PhD mainly focuses on the automated design of local search algorithms for vehicle routing problems with machine learning techniques. 
- First supervisor: [Professor Rong Qu](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~rxq)
- Second supervisor: [Professor Dario Landa-Silva](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszjds)

My main research interests now focus on decision support for Smart Transport and Smart Energy with AI techniques.

**Area of interests**

Real world applications: 
- Transport Logistic Scheduling and Vehicle Routing
  
AI Algorithms / techniques: 
- Automated Algorithm Design; Hyper-heuristics; Evolutionary Computation
- Machine Learning; Data Mining; Knowledge Explainability

**Selected projects**
I was a Research Assistant in the [Amicable Charging (AMiCC) research project](https://www.projectamicc.com/), delivering eco-friendly wireless charging solutions for electric vehicles, with a focus on optimizing the charging infrastructure. The project was led by Professor [Lucelia Rodrigues](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/departments/abe/people/lucelia.rodrigues) (University of Nottingham).

I recently completed a KTP project as a KTP Associate to develop and deploy novel and advanced hyper-heuristics-based routing technologies for haulage markets. The project was led by [Professor Ender Ozcan](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszeo/index.html) (University of Nottingham), [Dr Ahmed Kheiri](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/ahmed-kheiri) (Lancaster University), and [Optrak](https://optrak.com/), supported by KTP Scheme under [Project No.KTP11692](https://info.ktponline.org.uk/action/details/partnership.aspx?id=11692).
