I am currently a Data Scientist (KTP Associate) for Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with the [N/Lab](https://www.nlab.org.uk/) and the [Haydn Green Institute](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/business/who-we-are/centres-and-institutes/HGI/) in the Nottingham University Business School and [Strategic Innovation Limited](https://strategic-innovation.co.uk/). The [aim of this project](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/strategic-innovation-n-lab?utm_source=miragenews&utm_medium=miragenews&utm_campaign=news) is to utilise cutting-edge AI and Big Data analytics to drive transformational change in the food production system, towards sustainability.

Area of interests
----

Real world applications: 
- Challenges in Sustainable Food Systems
- Transport Logistic Scheduling and Vehicle Routing Problems
  
AI Algorithms / techniques: 
- Machine Learning; Data Mining; Knowledge Explainability
- Automated Algorithm Design; Hyper-heuristics; Evolutionary Computation; Combinatorial Optimisation

I completed my PhD at the [Computational Optimization and Learning (COL) Lab](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/col/).
- PhD Thesis: "[Automated Design of Local Search Algorithms for Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows](/files/thesis/Weiyao_Thesis202309.pdf)". University of Nottingham, 2023.
  - First supervisor: [Professor Rong Qu](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~rxq)
  - Second supervisor: [Professor Dario Landa-Silva](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszjds)

My research interests focus on using AI techniques to support decision-making in sustainable development, particularly in domains such as sustainable transport, energy and food systems.

Selected projects
----

I was a Research Assistant in the [Amicable Charging (AMiCC) research project](https://www.projectamicc.com/), delivering eco-friendly wireless charging solutions for electric vehicles, with a focus on optimizing the charging infrastructure. The project was led by [Professor Lucelia Rodrigues](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/departments/abe/people/lucelia.rodrigues) (University of Nottingham).

I lead the completion of a KTP project as a KTP Associate to develop and deploy novel and advanced hyper-heuristics-based routing technologies for haulage markets. The project was led by [Professor Ender Ozcan](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszeo/index.html) (University of Nottingham), [Dr Ahmed Kheiri](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/ahmed-kheiri) (Lancaster University), and [Optrak](https://optrak.com/), supported by KTP Scheme under [Project No.KTP11692](https://info.ktponline.org.uk/action/details/partnership.aspx?id=11692).
