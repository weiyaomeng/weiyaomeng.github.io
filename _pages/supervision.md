BSc/MSc Project Ideas (2023/24)
----

- Project scope
  - Machine Learning, Data Mining and Analysis; 
  - Heuristic Optimisation Algorithms
- Example problems
  - Transport scheduling / optimisation, vehicle routing, energy domain

Note: For inspiration, a few specific project ideas are included below. I am open to new ideas on related problem scenarios using appropriate algorithms/techniques. The scope should be related to AI optimisation or machine learning and depends on your skills and ability to learn quickly. Please drop me an email to discuss your interests further.

1. Machine learning into evolutionary computation
   - Type: research
   - Keywords: Machine learning, Meta-heuristics, Hyper-heuristics, Automated algorithm design
   - Programming: Java, Python, etc
   - Description: Machine learning and optimisation are two growing areas of AI. Both sets of techniques are frequently interacting with each other. This project will develop machine learning-assisted search algorithms for solving optimisation problems. Thorough experimentation over benchmark problem instances and analysis of results are expected.
   - Prerequisite (suitable for CS and AI, and Data Science students):
     - Knowledge in modern search algorithms
     - Skills in data mining and machine learning

2. Data visualisation for the design of search algorithms
   - Type: research
   - Keywords: Data visualisation, Meta-heuristics, Hyper-heuristics, Automated algorithm design
   - Programming: Java, Python, etc
   - Description: In solving complex combinatorial optimisation problems, the demand for effective algorithms presents a challenge and burden for human experts. This project will integrates data visualisation within recent algorithm design frameworks to enhance the understanding of the algorithm design process.
   - Prerequisite (suitable for CS and AI, and Data Science students):
     - Knowledge in modern search algorithms
     - Skills in data analysis and data visualisation

3. Machine learning on big data
   - Type: research
   - Keywords: Decision suppport; Machine learning
   - Programming: Python
   - Description: To build machine learning models on a large dataset of a selected problem application from Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.
   - Prerequisite (suitable for AI, and Data Science students):
     - Skills: Data processing and data mining techniques

4. Your own project idea
   - You are encouraged to develop your own project ideas of your own inetrests. The scope should be related to optimisation or machine learning, and depends on your skills and ability to learn quickly. 
   - I would suggest to follow the [easy 7 step format](https://jclos.github.io/projects/) provided by Dr Jeremie Clos to structure your idea into a decent project.
